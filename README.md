# Thistlethwaite

This is a cube solver based off of [Thistlethwaite's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimal_solutions_for_Rubik%27s_Cube#Thistlethwaite's_algorithm). Features:

 - Optimal; typically solves in around 20 moves
 - Efficient; usually finishes in under 10 seconds
 - Small; the source code is under 10KB
 - Independent; uses no heuristics tables

Based on Stefan Pochmann's [Thistlethwaite solver](http://www.stefan-pochmann.info/spocc/other_stuff/tools/) with permission.
