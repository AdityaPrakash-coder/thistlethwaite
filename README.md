# solver2
A better cube solver.

 - Optimal; usually solves in less than 20 moves
 - Efficient; usually finishes in under 10 seconds
 - Small; the source code is under 10KB
 - Independent; uses no heuristics tables

I found this [here](http://www.stefan-pochmann.info/spocc/other_stuff/tools/solver_thistlethwaite/solver_thistlethwaite_cpp.txt) and modified it. There was no license associated with the original source code.
